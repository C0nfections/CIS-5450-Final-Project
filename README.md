# Job Posting Popularity Forecaster

The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the job postings dataset through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and implementing various regression models to predict the number of applies a job posting will get based on factors such as location, skills, salary, views, and the presence of a remote option.

Ultimately, we can understand what factors make a job posting "popular," and aim to uncover patterns and insights that will inform us on how, given the state of the job market, people are approaching job applications.
